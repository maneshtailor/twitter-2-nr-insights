# twitter-2-nr-insights
A simple Java app that sends selected tweets to NR Insights

Edit the .java file and change all the 'CHANGE-ME' items to the relevant entries.
You will need to create keys for your Twitter account and you will also need to create an Insights API key

The only thing you need to change in the ini file is which twitter handles you want to subscribe to

The events will be added to the 'twittest' event type in your Insights account
